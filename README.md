# FBI-and-USA-Census-Data 

# Project #2 - Udacity Program

Run through Jupyter Anaconda - Using Python3
Import 'pandas', 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' 

# Main Body 

First, I collect all the data and see that it is visible in my coding. I use all the basic and general commands like .
- .info
- .describe 
- .isnull
- .duplicated
- etc to see if my code is working. 

Second, I clean the data so that I can start the analyses. 

__The Analyses__

Most of the data is simple and unconclusional. Therefore I need to make observations and see if there is a link between any figures. However, the importance of this project is to demonstrate how one can 'play around' with data by chosing different commands like:
- for in
- .iloc / loc
- .query
- .groupby
- len 

Most of the command let you see the specific part of the data that bring out the value in the end. 

# Conclusion 

As the gun data and census have been analysed. I have pinpointed two main features. 

Firstly  - **the data can not be linked together as it is two different data lists**

Second - **the gun data had too many Null Values which is impossible to draw a conclusion from**
